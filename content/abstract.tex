This section contains the abstract of your thesis. It should provide a concise summary of your research question, methodology, key findings, and conclusions. The abstract typically contains 150-300 words and should be self-contained, allowing readers to understand the essence of your work without reading the entire document.

Start with a clear statement of the problem or research question you are addressing. Then briefly describe your methodology or approach to solving this problem. Follow this with your main findings or results, and conclude with the implications or contributions of your work to the field.

Remember to keep the language clear and accessible, avoiding excessive jargon while maintaining academic rigor. The abstract is often the first (and sometimes only) part of your thesis that readers will see, so make it count.
